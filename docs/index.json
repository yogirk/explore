[{"categories":["Getting Started","Hugo"],"content":"Welcome to the Explore theme for Hugo! This guide will walk you through the steps to get your site up and running with this theme. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hugo or an experienced user, you\u0026rsquo;ll find everything you need to get started.\nPrerequisites Before we begin, you need to have Git installed on your machine to manage the theme as a submodule.\nStep 1: Install Hugo If you don\u0026rsquo;t have Hugo installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install it first. Hugo provides an official installation guide for all major operating systems.\nA quick way to install it on macOS is with Homebrew:\nbrew install hugo For other systems, please refer to the Official Hugo Installation Guide.\nStep 2: Create a New Hugo Site Once Hugo is installed, you can create a new site. Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to create your project, and run:\nhugo new site my-awesome-site cd my-awesome-site This will create a new directory named my-awesome-site with the basic Hugo site structure.\nStep 3: Install the Explore Theme The best way to add a theme to your Hugo site is by using Git submodules. This makes it easy to get theme updates in the future.\nFrom the root of your new site (my-awesome-site), initialize a Git repository and add the Explore theme as a submodule:\ngit init git submodule add https://github.com/yogirk/explore.git themes/explore Step 4: Configure Your Site The Explore theme comes with a detailed config.toml in its exampleSite directory. It\u0026rsquo;s the fastest way to get started.\nCopy the example configuration file to the root of your site:\ncp themes/explore/exampleSite/config.toml . Now, open the config.toml file in your favorite text editor. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to make sure the theme is set correctly. The example file should already have this, but it\u0026rsquo;s good to verify:\n# config.toml theme = \u0026#34;explore\u0026#34; You should also update the baseURL to your site\u0026rsquo;s URL and change other parameters like title, author, and description to match your site\u0026rsquo;s details.\nStep 5: Add Some Content You can create a new post using the hugo new command:\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md This will create a new Markdown file in content/posts/my-first-post.md with some pre-filled front matter from the theme\u0026rsquo;s archetype. Open it and add your content.\nStep 6: Run the Hugo Server You\u0026rsquo;re all set! Now, you can run the local Hugo server to see your site in action:\nhugo server This will start a local server, usually at http://localhost:1313/. Open this URL in your browser, and you should see your new site with the Explore theme!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Congratulations! Your site is live locally. From here, you can:\nTry a different look — switch fontPreset to \u0026quot;google-sans\u0026quot; or palette to \u0026quot;forest\u0026quot; in your config.toml and watch the site transform. See Customizing Your Theme for details. Read the Markdown \u0026amp; Typography Guide to see how to style your content. Check out the Explore Theme Features post for a deep dive into all configuration options. See the Interactive Features post for a hands-on tour of the reading progress bar, code copy button, ScrollSpy ToC, and more.

Or something seriously funny!\nHeading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Paragraphs and Text Styles This is a standard paragraph. It can contain bold text, italic text, and inline code.

Here is my take - \u0026ldquo;One might think of it, sir, as an attempt to bottle my services, but with the most vital ingredients left out. This \u0026lsquo;AI\u0026rsquo; can retrieve information with the speed of a startled gazelle and construct a plan with terrifying logic, yet it lacks the critical faculty of, shall we say, judgement.

Not the content — that comes later, and is a different kind of pleasure — but the typeface, the colors, the width of the column. The small decisions that determine whether a page feels like a well-set book or a photocopied handout.\n\u0026ldquo;The details are not the details. They make the design.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Charles Eames\nExplore gives you a few deliberate knobs to turn. This guide covers each one.\nFont Presets The theme ships with two self-hosted font presets. No external requests are made — all font files live in the theme\u0026rsquo;s static/fonts/ directory.\nInter (Default) Role Typeface Weights Sans-serif Inter 400, 700 Monospace JetBrains Mono 400 Inter is a clean, neutral typeface designed for screens. If you have no strong preference, this is a solid default.\nGoogle Sans Role Typeface Weights Sans-serif Google Sans Flex 400, 700 Monospace Google Sans Code 400 Google Sans Flex is a friendlier, more geometric face. It gives the site a slightly warmer, more modern feel.\nTo switch presets, set a single line in your config.toml:\n[params.style] fontPreset = \u0026#34;google-sans\u0026#34; That\u0026rsquo;s it. The entire site — body text, headings, code blocks — updates to use the new preset\u0026rsquo;s families.\nColor Palettes Explore includes four named color palettes. Each palette defines its own primary and accent colors for both light and dark modes, so contrast is maintained regardless of the user\u0026rsquo;s preference.\nPalette Light Primary Light Accent Feel default #1a73e8 #1e8e3e Familiar blue and green. Dependable. ocean #0077b6 #00838f Deep teal tones. Calm and professional. forest #2d6a4f #52b788 Rich greens. Warm and organic. slate #475569 #64748b Muted grays. Understated, editorial. To apply a palette:\n[params.style] palette = \u0026#34;forest\u0026#34; When a named palette is active, it overrides any primary or accent values you may have set. The palette owns the colors.\nCustom Colors If none of the built-in palettes suit you, set palette = \u0026quot;default\u0026quot; and define your own primary and accent colors:\n[params.style] palette = \u0026#34;default\u0026#34; primary = \u0026#34;#6C3DBF\u0026#34; accent = \u0026#34;#5FA8A3\u0026#34; These values are injected as CSS custom properties (--color-primary and --color-accent) and propagate throughout the theme — links, buttons, hover states, the reading progress bar, and more.\nA few things to keep in mind when choosing custom colors:\nContrast: Ensure your primary color has at least a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against the background for WCAG AA compliance. Dark mode: Custom colors are used in both light and dark modes. The theme brightens them slightly in dark mode, but very dark primaries may not look right. Test in both modes. Accent usage: The accent color is used sparingly — hover states, highlights, a few decorative elements. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be bold. Container Width \u0026amp; Typography Two settings control how wide the content spreads:\n[params.style] containerMaxWidth = \u0026#34;1280px\u0026#34; maxWidthCh = 75 containerMaxWidth is the overall page width (header, footer, sidebar grid). Any valid CSS value works: \u0026quot;1280px\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;80rem\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;90vw\u0026quot;. maxWidthCh is the max width of the readable content column, measured in ch units (roughly the width of the character \u0026ldquo;0\u0026rdquo;). 75 characters is a comfortable reading measure for most typefaces. The type scale uses a Minor Third ratio (1.2x), producing a harmonious progression from small labels to large headings. This isn\u0026rsquo;t configurable — it\u0026rsquo;s baked into the design tokens — but the fluid spacing system ensures it looks right at any viewport width.\nDesign Token Architecture Under the hood, all visual values are expressed as CSS custom properties organized into three tiers:\nPrimitive tokens — raw values: color scales, spacing values, font stacks, shadow definitions. These are the building blocks and are never used directly in component styles.\nSemantic tokens — purpose-based aliases: --color-primary, --color-text, --space-m, --font-body. These are what components reference. In dark mode, semantic tokens are remapped to different primitives.\nComponent tokens — scoped overrides: --header-bg, --card-border, --callout-info-bg. These let individual components diverge from the semantic defaults without breaking the system.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to understand this architecture to use the theme — fontPreset, palette, primary, and accent in your config.toml are enough. But if you ever want to extend or override styles in a custom stylesheet, knowing the token layers makes it straightforward to do so without fighting the cascade.\n\u0026ldquo;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Antoine de Saint-Exupery\n","tags":["guide","style","typography","features"],"title":"Customizing Your Theme","uri":"/explore/posts/customizing-your-theme/"},{"categories":["Features"],"content":"This post is its own demonstration. Every interactive feature described below is active right now, on this page. Scroll, click, hover — the best way to understand these features is to use them.\n\u0026ldquo;I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Confucius (attributed)\nReading Progress Bar Look at the very top of your browser window. There\u0026rsquo;s a thin colored bar stretching across the viewport. As you scroll down this page, it fills from left to right, showing how far you\u0026rsquo;ve read.\nThe bar uses requestAnimationFrame for smooth, jank-free updates. It appears on all single post pages automatically — no configuration needed. The color follows your theme\u0026rsquo;s primary color, so it adapts to whichever palette you\u0026rsquo;ve chosen.\nScroll down to watch it grow. Scroll back up to watch it shrink.\nCode Copy Button Every fenced code block on the site includes a Copy button in the top-right corner. Hover over any of the blocks below to see it appear.\nGo package main import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; func main() { fmt.Println(\u0026#34;Hello from Explore!\u0026#34;) } Python def greet(name: str) -\u0026gt; str: return f\u0026#34;Hello, {name}!\u0026#34; if __name__ == \u0026#34;__main__\u0026#34;: print(greet(\u0026#34;Explore\u0026#34;)) JavaScript const greet = (name) =\u0026gt; `Hello, ${name}!`; console.log(greet(\u0026#34;Explore\u0026#34;)); HTML \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html lang=\u0026#34;en\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;meta charset=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;Explore\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Hello, Explore!\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Click Copy on any block above. The button text changes to \u0026ldquo;Copied!\u0026rdquo; for two seconds as confirmation, then resets. The language label (Go, Python, JavaScript, HTML) is detected automatically from the code fence.\nTheme Toggle Find the sun/moon icon in the site header. Click it.\nThe entire page transitions smoothly between light and dark modes — no flash, no repaint glitch. The theme applies CSS transitions to background colors, text colors, borders, and shadows so the switch feels deliberate rather than jarring.\nYour preference is saved to localStorage, so it persists across page loads and sessions. On first visit, the theme respects your operating system\u0026rsquo;s prefers-color-scheme setting.\nTry toggling a few times. Notice how the reading progress bar, code blocks, cards, and even the callout boxes all adapt their colors.\nScrollSpy Table of Contents If you\u0026rsquo;re reading this on a wide enough screen, there\u0026rsquo;s a table of contents in the sidebar. Watch it as you scroll — the currently visible section is highlighted, and the highlight moves as you pass from one heading to the next.\nThe ScrollSpy uses IntersectionObserver to detect which heading is in view, avoiding the performance cost of scroll event listeners. It activates automatically when the ToC is placed in the left or right position.\nThis section is deliberately placed in the middle of the post so you can observe the ToC tracking your position as you continue reading.\nCard Hover Effects This feature is visible on list pages (the homepage, category pages, tag pages) rather than on this single post. Navigate to the Posts page and hover over any post card.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll see:\nThe card lifts slightly (a 4px vertical translation) A larger shadow appears beneath it The post title changes to the primary color The entire card is clickable — not just the title — thanks to an invisible overlay link. The effect is subtle but gives the interface a tactile, responsive quality.\nBreadcrumb Navigation Look at the top of this page, just below the header. You should see a breadcrumb trail like:\nHome \u0026gt; Posts \u0026gt; Interactive Features\nBreadcrumbs appear on all inner pages and provide a clear path back to parent sections. They use semantic \u0026lt;nav\u0026gt; markup with aria-label=\u0026quot;breadcrumb\u0026quot; for accessibility.\nEverything at Once If you\u0026rsquo;ve followed along, you\u0026rsquo;ve now experienced all six interactive features on a single page visit:\nReading progress — the bar at the top has been tracking your scroll position this entire time Code copy — you (hopefully) tried copying at least one code block Theme toggle — the sun/moon icon in the header ScrollSpy — the sidebar ToC has been highlighting sections as you passed them Card hover — visible on any list page Breadcrumbs — the navigation trail at the top None of these features require configuration. They activate automatically. And because the JavaScript is wrapped in an IIFE and uses modern APIs like IntersectionObserver and requestAnimationFrame, they add minimal overhead to page load.\n\u0026ldquo;Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ndash; Leonardo da Vinci (attributed)\n","tags":["features","demo","documentation"],"title":"Interactive Features","uri":"/explore/posts/interactive-features/"},{"categories":["Layouts","Features"],"content":"This post demonstrates a page with a widget sidebar but no Table of Contents in the sidebar.\nThe theme\u0026rsquo;s logic first checks if the Table of Contents is configured to display in the left or right sidebar.
