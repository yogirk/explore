[{"categories":["Getting Started","Hugo"],"content":"Welcome to the Explore theme for Hugo! This guide will walk you through the steps to get your site up and running with this theme. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hugo or an experienced user, you\u0026rsquo;ll find everything you need to get started.\nPrerequisites Before we begin, you need to have Git installed on your machine to manage the theme as a submodule.\nStep 1: Install Hugo If you don\u0026rsquo;t have Hugo installed, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to install it first. Hugo provides an official installation guide for all major operating systems.\nA quick way to install it on macOS is with Homebrew:\nbrew install hugo For other systems, please refer to the Official Hugo Installation Guide.\nStep 2: Create a New Hugo Site Once Hugo is installed, you can create a new site. Open your terminal, navigate to where you want to create your project, and run:\nhugo new site my-awesome-site cd my-awesome-site This will create a new directory named my-awesome-site with the basic Hugo site structure.\nStep 3: Install the Explore Theme The best way to add a theme to your Hugo site is by using Git submodules. This makes it easy to get theme updates in the future.\nFrom the root of your new site (my-awesome-site), initialize a Git repository and add the Explore theme as a submodule:\ngit init git submodule add https://github.com/yogirk/explore.git themes/explore Step 4: Configure Your Site The Explore theme comes with a detailed config.toml in its exampleSite directory. It\u0026rsquo;s the fastest way to get started.\nCopy the example configuration file to the root of your site:\ncp themes/explore/exampleSite/config.toml . Now, open the config.toml file in your favorite text editor. You\u0026rsquo;ll need to make sure the theme is set correctly. The example file should already have this, but it\u0026rsquo;s good to verify:\n# config.toml theme = \u0026#34;explore\u0026#34; You should also update the baseURL to your site\u0026rsquo;s URL and change other parameters like title, author, and description to match your site\u0026rsquo;s details.\nStep 5: Add Some Content You can create a new post using the hugo new command:\nhugo new posts/my-first-post.md This will create a new Markdown file in content/posts/my-first-post.md with some pre-filled front matter from the theme\u0026rsquo;s archetype. Open it and add your content.\nStep 6: Run the Hugo Server You\u0026rsquo;re all set! Now, you can run the local Hugo server to see your site in action:\nhugo server This will start a local server, usually at http://localhost:1313/. Open this URL in your browser, and you should see your new site with the Explore theme!\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next? Congratulations! Your site is live locally. From here, you can:\nExplore the config.toml file to customize the theme\u0026rsquo;s features, colors, and layout. Read the Markdown \u0026amp; Typography Guide to see how to style your content. Check out the Explore Theme Features post for a deep dive into all configuration options.

Although, If you ever have to reach heading 6, you are doing something serious or funny. Or something seriously funny!\nHeading 1 Heading 2 Heading 3 Heading 4 Heading 5 Heading 6 Paragraphs and Text Styles This is a standard paragraph. It can contain bold text, italic text, and inline code. You can also create links to other websites.\nWhen you have to write a paragraph but you don\u0026rsquo;t want to use lorem ipsum, for such a lifeless text is an insult to reader\u0026rsquo;s intelligence - all you need to do is summon PG Wodehouse and imagine how Jeeves would explain AI to Wooster. Here is my take - \u0026ldquo;One might think of it, sir, as an attempt to bottle my services, but with the most vital ingredients left out. This \u0026lsquo;AI\u0026rsquo; can retrieve information with the speed of a startled gazelle and construct a plan with terrifying logic, yet it lacks the critical faculty of, shall we say, judgement. It could devise a dozen ways to extricate you from a locked room, but would be utterly flummoxed if asked to tactfully dissuade your Aunt Agatha from wearing her new hat.\u0026rdquo;\nBlockquotes Blockquotes are useful for highlighting sections of text. We can invoke someone more serious than Wodehouse, Mr Salinger.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not afraid to compete. It\u0026rsquo;s just the opposite. Don\u0026rsquo;t you see that? I\u0026rsquo;m afraid I will compete â€” that\u0026rsquo;s what scares me. That\u0026rsquo;s why I quit the Theatre Department. Just because I\u0026rsquo;m so horribly conditioned to accept everybody else\u0026rsquo;s values, and just because I like applause and people to rave about me, doesn\u0026rsquo;t make it right. I\u0026rsquo;m ashamed of it. I\u0026rsquo;m sick of it. I\u0026rsquo;m sick of not having the courage to be an absolute nobody. I\u0026rsquo;m sick of myself and everybody else that wants to make some kind of a splash\n\u0026ndash; J.D.

When I say \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rdquo;, it is I and my good friend Gemini Code Assist\nFigure Use the figure shortcode for images with captions. It generates responsive images.\nThis image is generated with ChatGPT. Callout Use the callout shortcode to draw attention to important information. If you want the prompt I used for generating this image, here you go.\nPrompt: A majestic bald eagle flying low over a perfectly still, crystal-clear alpine lake, with its wings spread wide and just above the water\u0026rsquo;s surface, creating a soft ripple. The lake reflects the eagle, the surrounding dense pine forest, and the distant snow-capped mountains. The scene is symmetrically framed with a vivid blue sky, serene and peaceful atmosphere, and cinematic depth of field. Shot from behind the eagle, centered in the frame, capturing the moment it glides gracefully into the wild. Warning: This is a warning callout. Use it for important caveats or warnings.

If it is, the ToC takes precedence.\nIf the ToC is set to inline or is disabled (like on this page with toc: false), the theme will then check for the sidebar.position setting. If that is set to left or right, the widget area will be displayed.\nThis allows for flexible layouts where some pages might have a ToC for navigation, while others might feature widgets for discovery.\n","tags":["widgets","sidebar","demo"],"title":"A Post with Widgets","uri":"/explore/posts/post-with-widgets/"}]
